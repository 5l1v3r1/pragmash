# pragmash

**pragmash** is a simple, flexible scripting language. It is made to be dropped into other systems (i.e. build systems, scripting environments, etc.).

The name "pragmash" is an abbreviation of the words "pragmatic" and "shell" put together. I want pragmash to be as practical as possible: it doesn't have to be elegant, just useful. I also want it to feel like writing for a shell (with barewords support and a simple command architecture).
