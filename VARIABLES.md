# Variables

A few variables are defined at the start of a pragmash script. Here is documentation for all of them.

# ARGV

This is an array of arguments passed to the script. This will not include the script name or pragmash command, so it may be empty.

# DIR

This is the directory which contains the main script. This will not change or do anything fancy for the `exec` command.
